    <p name="fb5e" id="fb5e">Banking apps are some of the most important and often used apps. There are certain features that aren&rsquo;t used often but are very important and unable to find it so often leads to frustration because banking plays an important role in everyone&rsquo;s daily life. So I set out to solve the common problems faced by the common man by design a banking app, that is not a redesign of any specific banking app in particular but an overall better design with feedback from people across diverse cultures.</p>
  </div>

<div>
  <div>
    <h3 name="128f" id="128f">Goal</h3>
    <p name="ff31" id="ff31">Design a banking app that puts the needs of users where they can intuitively find it. And, while at it, use a bit of predictive technology (or the hyped AI) to assist the user in finding important contextual features.</p>
    <h3 name="dda0" id="dda0">Empathize with Users</h3>
    <h4 name="0cc9" id="0cc9">Interviews</h4>
    <p name="3240" id="3240">A <strong>total of three interviews</strong> were conducted, where participants had to answer questions regarding their bank app usage habits and what motivates or demotivates them from using it. <strong>Two of the participants were regular users of their respective bank apps and one was a new user.</strong></p>
    <p name="ce5a" id="ce5a"><strong>Needs and motivations</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li name="69cf" id="69cf"><strong>All participants </strong>said that they <strong>regularly check </strong>their bank apps for the <strong>transactions and current balance.</strong></li>
      <li name="e4c8" id="e4c8">1 user was more into <strong>sharing bills with friends frequently</strong> but complained that it was a lengthy process.</li>
      <li name="aa6d" id="aa6d">1 user was new to country and the <strong>banking terms was jarring </strong>and <strong>finding even simple options were difficult the first time</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <hr />
</div>
<div>
  <div>
    <h4 name="ec38" id="ec38">Persona</h4>
    <p name="2866" id="2866"><em>Throughout the interviews, I noticed that users had difficulty understanding certain features and terminology of the apps. Some tasks sent them in rounds trying to find it. They also were quite unsure if some transaction that they hadn&rsquo;t carried out before was free or if it was charged. Also there were certain issues that they said out loud that bothered them.</em></p>
    <p name="94ad" id="94ad">Persona #1: I regularly use simple activities like checking balance and transactions. But it is the less frequently used options stuff that I have difficulty finding and don&rsquo;t really understand.</p>
    <p name="f406" id="f406">Persona #2: I regularly send money to friends when bills are split but it is such a lengthy process, I wish it were easier.</p>
    <p name="c87c" id="c87c">Persona #3: New user in new country with new banking system.</p>
    <p name="c0d9" id="c0d9">Thus I was able to identify the personas and their key pain points.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 name="a0a8" id="a0a8">Defining the Problem</h3>
    <p name="64d6" id="64d6">After identifying and analyzing users&rsquo; pain points, I defined the following common ones that most users were having trouble.</p>
    <h4 name="a6cd" id="a6cd">Pain Point #1: Navigation</h4>
    <p name="ecf1" id="ecf1">Users had to navigate a lot for common tasks such as finding the current balance across accounts, balance, recent transactions and transferring money to others.</p>
    <blockquote name="3e3b" id="3e3b">Common tasks should be thrown on my face or should be one click away and not after digging deep. I use it often and I find it frustrating!</blockquote>
    <h4 name="9b51" id="9b51">Pain Point #2: Discoverability</h4>
    <p name="efe6" id="efe6">New users or rather finding less used option were difficult and they struggled to find simple options like card payment, the due date and the feature to find ATM, etc.</p>
    <blockquote name="f6b9" id="f6b9">I was supposed to pay the card bill by tomorrow and I couldn&rsquo;t find the option. It was public holiday and I freaked out. I don&rsquo;t want to pay extra fines.</blockquote>
    <h4 name="a2ef" id="a2ef">Pain point # 3: Clarity</h4>
    <p name="114e" id="114e">Some transactions didn&rsquo;t make any sense at all. This confuses the user when he/she tries to recall what the transaction was made for.</p>
    <blockquote name="d6e5" id="d6e5">I find some transactions that read along the lines of IH123 E-TFR**45. What does that even mean? I will remember for a while but a few days later, I will be totally clueless on what the transaction is all about.</blockquote>
    <h4 name="fd45" id="fd45">Pain Point #4: Forgetfulness</h4>
    <p name="775f" id="775f">There are times when the user doesn&rsquo;t have enough money to carry out a transaction and would forget to carry it out at a later point in time.</p>
    <blockquote name="3815" id="3815">I owed someone(or pay for my credit card) and I wanted to pay last week but I didn&rsquo;t have enough money so I postponed until I got the money. Then I forgot and that put me in a situation.</blockquote>
    <p name="6241" id="6241">Transferring fund from credit card to savings or checking accounts incur transaction charges and first time users weren&rsquo;t aware of this.</p>
    <blockquote name="dc80" id="dc80">Once I transferred my funds from credit card to checking account. I wanted to do it the other way round but I was in a hurry and I didn&rsquo;t realize that and ended up getting charged for the transaction.</blockquote>
    <h4 name="c84d" id="c84d">Pain Point #5: Panic</h4>
    <p name="c6f4" id="c6f4">When it comes to money, everyone panics and no one want to lose their hard earned money. Apps used by the user didn&rsquo;t seem to help this. And this is one of the rarely used features but an extremely important one in times of need.</p>
    <blockquote name="c603" id="c603">I lost my credit card and I didn&rsquo;t have the customer care number saved and couldn&rsquo;t find it fast. I panicked and didn&rsquo;t know what to do. I didn&rsquo;t have proper data service and the app needed me to go online. It took me a long time to find it on the app.</blockquote>

    <p name="5ff6" id="5ff6">After defining the problems and analyzing each pain point. I was ready to come up with solutions.</p>
    <h4 name="b3b7" id="b3b7">Brainstorming</h4>
    <p name="c3bf" id="c3bf">After consolidating all the problems and prioritizing them as per the frequency in which it was used, the results of the data and the brainstorm helped me narrow down on the approach.</p>

      <li name="228b" id="228b"><strong>Add Notes:</strong> When a user revisits cryptic transactions after a few days, he/she maybe daunted.

I added a reminder feature for the user to initiate a transaction and be reminded on a certain set date or after the balance in a certain account increases.

    An emergency option will put the bank in contact with the user at the drop of a hat!
    <p name="1716" id="1716"><strong><em>Proposed solution</em></strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li name="75d5" id="75d5"><strong>Temporary Block:</strong>Users have the tendency to easily misplace /forget things. While traveling or out somewhere, they should be allowed to temporarily block a card meaning, no transaction can be carried out until call the customer care. This will ensure that the card is not misused until it is found. If the card is not found for 3 days or not been called by the customer, it can be blocked permanently. Also a user can login to a public internet cafe and might fear that someone may misuse the account</li>
      <li name="06a6" id="06a6"><strong>Customer Assistance:</strong> When a user panics, he/she will not be patient enough to wait for a long time on the IVR call or searching for the customer service number. Entitling a user to have the customer care call the user for free once or twice a month will not only solve this but incredibly enhance the user experience when in times of need.</li>
